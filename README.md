# ContactList
The driver for this programm is TestContactList.java

The programm was developed as part of an assessment in my first semester of Java.
Users can create, edit and delete a contact. 

Project discription: 
As part of the design of a Contacts List application that will be included in the software supplied for a mobile phone we want to develop a Contact class that will be used to store the data for a single contact. Once we have the Contact class developed we can use it to create multiple instances which will become the entries in the Contact List stored in the phone. ContactList Class stores an array of Contacts and allows us to manipulate the entries in it.
